     This is similar to EXIF's orientation.
     Directional values ($up, $down, $left, $right) indicate the final direction in
     which the top of the image will be facing (e.g. a picture of a house will have
     its roof pointing to the right if the $right orientation is used).
     Flipping values ($flip_horizontal and $flip_vertical) can be additionaly added
     to produce a mirroring in each axis.
     Not to be confused with @Efl.Ui.Dir which is meant for widgets, rather
     than images and canvases. This enum is used to rotate images, videos and
     the like.
