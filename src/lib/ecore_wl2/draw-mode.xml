	The different state values used on the surface. This is designed for
	state values like maximized, fullscreen. It is paired with the
	configure event to ensure that both the client and the compositor
	setting the state can be synchronized.

	States set in this way are double-buffered. They will get applied on
	the next commit.

	Compositors will pass a draw mode in every states array when the mode is
	not "CSD with optional dropshadow".
