- eo_composite_attach
   check that the class of comp_obj is part of parent extensions

- Eo2_Call_Stack
   grow/shrink
   per thread stack

- cleanup EO2_VERSION specific code in eo.c and eo_private.c

- m4 __attribute__ cleanup ??? don't remember what it means

- Move the Op_Descs to be set using a function inside the class_constructor
   check if it works ASIS on windows
   if it does, do nothing

- function name from pointer
   dladdr backtrace ??

- Merge class and object, just like eo1

- Change the order of EO2_OP_FUNC* functions to put the ID first?

- Get rid of some of the EO2_VOID_FUNC_BODY macros using different number of macro params
    - __ is reserved, change that.

- Add line number to errors (like in eo1...)

- Migrate mixin and suite tests

- Fix return values in all the eo2_base functions, like eo2_event_freeze_get

- A bit annoying that we don't get type checks on the callbacks, fix that? That's really dangerous!

- Get all the optimisations cedric has been doing to Eo1? I think that's where the children thing got lost...A
